# @bymax-one/nest-storage — AGENTS.md

`@bymax-one/nest-storage` is a published NestJS library that wraps a single `@aws-sdk/client-s3`
`S3Client` behind a provider-agnostic API — upload, download, head, list, copy, delete, and
presigned GET/PUT/multipart URLs — across AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, DigitalOcean Spaces,
MinIO and Wasabi. It ships zero runtime dependencies; everything it needs is a peer dependency the
consuming application owns.

Start with `CLAUDE.md`, which is the full contract for working in this repository: the nine critical
rules, the subpath export map, the quality gates and the commit conventions. This file does not
restate it. What follows is the review layer, and then the architecture deep-dive `CLAUDE.md` points
at.

## Code Review Rules

<!-- shared:begin -->
<!--
  CANONICAL COPY: bymaxone/.github → agents/code-review-rules.md
  Do not edit this block in a consuming repository. It is replaced wholesale by
  the `agents-sync` reusable workflow, so a local edit is reverted on the next
  run. Change it here, cut a release, and every repository is offered the update.

  Repository-specific rules go OUTSIDE this block, below the closing marker.

  FOR WHOEVER EDITS THIS FILE, not for the reviewer who reads it:

  Codex reads one AGENTS.md per directory, root to nested, within
  project_doc_max_bytes (32 KiB default). Never name a template or fixture
  AGENTS.md below the root: a change under it is read as the repo's guidance.

  This block is charged against every consumer's budget. A rule added here must
  be worth the bytes in the smallest-headroom repository, not only in this one;
  agents-sync reports each consumer's headroom and fails when it is exceeded.

  When you scope a rule, scope every rule in its paragraph or split the
  paragraph -- an unscoped neighbour reads as deliberate.
-->

These rules hold in every Bymax repository. What is specific to this one is written after this
block, and the two are read together.

The pipeline already enforces formatting, linting, dependency policy, coverage and — where the
repository has one — the mutation gate. Do not spend a review on a **violation** of one of those: it
is a red check, not a comment. What follows is what CI cannot see.

A violation of a rule in this block is reported at **P1** at minimum. Codex surfaces only P0 and P1
on a pull request, so a rule whose violations land at P2 is a rule nobody sees.

**When a rule moves from here into a check, it leaves here.** A red check is proportionate to a
correctness failure that is invisible without it, and disproportionate to style enforced at an
inconvenient moment. Never carry both: a rule stated here _and_ enforced by CI spends a reviewer's
attention on what a gate already reports.

**A change to the enforcing configuration is the opposite case, and it is in scope.** Every gate runs
the configuration from the branch under review — that branch's lint config, its coverage thresholds,
its mutation thresholds. So a pull request that deletes a rule, lowers a threshold or widens an
ignore glob turns the check **green**, because a gate reports on the rules it was handed. For those
diffs the review is the only independent check there is, and a weakened gate needs the same
justification a suppression does.

### A finding names what it read

Every factual claim in a review — about a library's API, about this repository's history, about what
a file contains — has to come from something read in the tree under review, and the finding should
say which. A claim assembled from recollection is likely to describe a previous version of whatever
it is about.

**Safe path**, by the kind of claim:

| Claim about                             | Read this                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A library's API **shape**               | `node_modules/<pkg>/dist/**/*.d.ts` in this tree                               |
| A library's **runtime behaviour**       | that version's changelog entry, its documentation, or a test that exercises it |
| A commit's author or committer identity | out of scope: it is not text a change introduces                               |
| What a file contains                    | the file at the revision under review, not an earlier one                      |

The first two rows are separate on purpose, and the rule below says why: a field can stay optional
in the published type while becoming mandatory in behaviour. A `.d.ts` settles what a signature
accepts and nothing about what the implementation does with it, so a behavioural claim resting on
one is unfounded.

Weight the checking by what acting on the finding would cost. A comment that asks for a reworded
sentence is cheap to be wrong about; one that asks for history to be rewritten, a merge reverted, or
a release pulled is not — verify that class before raising it, and raise it at the severity the
evidence supports rather than the severity the consequence would deserve if true.

### A dependency upgrade migrates every call site, not only the ones that fail to compile

When an upgrade tightens a contract, the compiler catches only the call sites whose **shape**
changed. A field that stays optional in the published type while becoming mandatory in behaviour
compiles, passes the unit suite, and fails in production.

A `@bymax-one/*` version number carries **no compatibility information** while the libraries are
pre-stable: breaking changes ship in minor and patch releases by explicit policy, so `^` and `~`
protect against nothing. The migration note under **Apply to a derived backend** in the library's own
changelog is the compatibility contract.

**Safe path:** read **every** changelog entry from the version being replaced up to the proposed
one, not only the proposed one's, and check every call site they name — not only the ones the
compiler rejected. Upgrades routinely skip releases, and the entry that matters is often not the
last one: adopting `@bymax-one/nest-cache` 1.1.0 → 1.2.1 skipped 1.2.0, where a namespace-validation
security fix lives; 1.2.1's own entry is a field rename. Diff the `.d.ts` of the **previously adopted** version against
the **proposed** one — `npm pack` both, and name the two versions. Reaching for "the installed
declarations" is the trap: in a checkout of the branch under review the installed tree is already
the new version, so that diff compares a release with itself and shows nothing.

### Settled decisions are not review findings

Both are settled deliberately, and reopening either costs a round trip and changes nothing:

- **Do not propose a major version bump** for a breaking change in a `@bymax-one/*` library, and do
  not assert that this ecosystem follows strict SemVer. Until an API is declared stable, breaking
  changes ship in minor and patch releases; the migration note carries the compatibility information
  the number does not. If a document claims strict SemVer, the finding is that the claim is wrong —
  not that the version should be raised.
- **Do not propose pinning `bymaxone/.github` reusable workflows to a commit SHA.** They are
  referenced by the `@v1` alias on purpose: a fix has to land once and reach every repository, the
  tag is immutable and the alias moves only on a release, and pinning was measured to cost ~58
  dependency pull requests to propagate one change. Third-party actions are the opposite case and
  **are** pinned by SHA.

**Safe path:** if you believe a settled decision is now wrong, say so as a question in the pull
request rather than as a finding.

### Suppressions are refusals, not exceptions

`@ts-ignore`, `@ts-expect-error`, `@ts-nocheck`, `eslint-disable` in any form,
`as unknown as` laundering a real type error, `istanbul ignore`, and in Rust `#[allow(...)]` over a
lint gate or `unsafe` without a `// SAFETY:` comment are blocking findings.

Anything a configured gate already reports belongs to the gate, not to a review: where a repository
lints `no-explicit-any` as an error — most do — an `as any` is a red check, and raising it here only
duplicates it. Check the repository's lint configuration before reporting a suppression rather than
assuming the list is exhaustive in either direction.

A failing gate means the code is wrong, the type is wrong, or the rule is wrong. **Safe path:** fix
whichever it is. Changing a rule's configuration with a stated reason is legitimate; scattering
per-call-site silencers is not.

### Comments state constraints, never history

A comment must read as true for whoever opens the file next. Flag any comment that narrates what a
previous version did, names a phase, task, ticket or review round, or explains a change rather than
the code. **Safe path:** state the constraint that still holds, and let `git log` carry the history.

Evidence for a constraint is not history, and how the evidence was obtained does not decide which it
is. The test is whether the fact still binds the next reader. A measurement that predicts what they
will hit if they take the other path — what the alternative did when it was tried, what the cost is
in numbers — belongs beside the constraint it supports, whether it came from a deliberate trial or
from something breaking. What ages is the part that cannot recur for them: what a previous version
of this code did, a version number, a registry state, a review round, a failure that has since been
fixed. Flag those; keep the measurement.

### Size and layering

Functions over **50 lines** and nesting deeper than four levels are findings **for what a change
introduces** — a new function, or a change that pushes an existing one past the limit — in the
repository's own source and test directories. A test-suite grouping construct (`describe`, `context`,
`mod tests`, a table of cases) is not a function; the unit under the limit is the body of a single
`it`/`test`/`#[test]`. On the same terms, every non-trivial source file a change introduces opens
with a header stating its purpose and its layer, and every exported symbol a change introduces
carries a doc comment.

**The 800-line file limit applies to what a change introduces, not to what it inherits.** A
repository that already carries a file past the line — a generator, a long end-to-end suite — would
otherwise produce a finding on every pull request touching three lines of it, which the author
cannot act on and did not cause. Raise it for a **new** file over the limit, or when a change pushes
a file past it or materially grows one already over.

Markdown, generated output and lockfiles are **out of scope**: a changelog is an append-only log that
only grows, a lockfile is generated, and neither has layers. Reporting their length is a false
positive on every dependency bump and every release note.

**Safe path:** extract by responsibility rather than by line count — the limit is a symptom, and one
file doing two jobs is the defect.

### Language and attribution

Everything published is English — source, comments, tests, commit messages, pull request titles and
bodies, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` and everything under `.github/`.

Each repository states its language policy for `docs/` below this block. Report a language finding in
`docs/` only against what the repository states; where it states nothing, `docs/` is English like
everything else. A `docs/` language other than English is a repository-owner decision recorded in the
narrowings, not a convention a contributor may introduce.

No commit, pull request, comment or code may attribute authorship to an AI assistant or coding tool,
in any form. **Only text the change introduces is in scope** — a trailer, a "generated with" line, a
signature in a comment or a description.

A commit's author and committer fields are not that: they come from the contributor's git
configuration rather than from the diff, and a review reading the diff cannot see them. Never report
an identity field, and never present a command's reconstructed output as evidence for one. Measured:
eight P1 findings in a single day across four pull requests, each naming a commit SHA that does not
exist in the repository it was reported against and quoting `git log` output no review had run. What
each one asked for was a force-push rewriting published history.

<!-- shared:end -->

## Where this repository narrows a shared rule

The block above holds across every Bymax repository. Three of its rules have a sharper form here,
and this is that form — not a disagreement with the shared text.

- **Size and layering applies to `src/` and `test/`.** No file is over the 800-line limit today;
  `src/server/services/storage.service.ts` (747) and its spec (751) are the two closest to it. The
  shared rule is about what a change introduces, and here that means a change that pushes either of
  those past the line.
- **`// Stryker disable next-line <Mutator>: <reason>` is the one accepted annotation**, and only
  over a documented equivalent mutant with the reason stated inline. It suppresses nothing the
  compiler or the linter would have caught — it tells the mutation gate that a surviving mutant is
  behaviourally identical, which no gate can decide on its own. It is not on the shared suppression
  list and is not a finding here. Every other form on that list still is.
- **A commit-authorship finding must quote a SHA that `git cat-file -t` resolves.** The shared rule
  already says to read the identity before reporting it; here the evidence has to be a real object,
  quoted from a command actually run against the tree under review. The failure mode is specific and
  it recurs: the first Codex review on this repository reported an AI author for an object id that
  exists nowhere in it, and `bymax-one` saw the same shape four times on one pull request — one of
  those named a real commit, which carried a human author. Every identity in this repository's
  history is the maintainer, `GitHub <noreply@github.com>` from a squash merge, or `dependabot[bot]`.
  A genuine violation is still a finding, and git's author and committer fields remain out of scope
  for the attribution rule, which governs text a change introduces.

## Rules specific to this repository

Each of these has a shape a reviewer would otherwise get wrong, and each names where to read it.

### A presigned URL is a bearer credential

Anyone holding the URL has the access it encodes, for as long as it lives. It is never logged, never
a span attribute, never `StorageException.details`, never a field an error reporter would capture,
and never returned in a response that is itself logged. Treat a diff that puts one anywhere
observable the way you would treat a diff that logs an access key.

### The `credentials` accessor is deliberately invisible to a spread

`applyDefaults` attaches `credentials` to the resolved options as a **non-enumerable accessor**
(`src/server/config/apply-defaults.ts`), not as a plain field. That object is injected into every
service, so an enumerable field is emitted by anything that serialises one incidentally — a
structured logger rendering its arguments, an error reporter capturing the scope of a throw, an
object spread. The accessor also keeps it out of `util.inspect({ showHidden: true })`, which a
diagnostic dump uses and which still prints a hidden **data** property.

A reviewer who sees `credentials` "missing" after a spread, or absent from `JSON.stringify` output,
is looking at the fix working. Do not propose restoring it as a plain field, spreading the resolved
options into a new object literal, or `Object.assign`-ing them somewhere — each of those undoes it
silently. Reads are unaffected: `options.credentials.accessKeyId` resolves exactly as before.

### `SignedPutUrlOptions.maxSizeBytes` is advisory, and says so

SigV4 can pin an **exact** `Content-Length` into a PUT signature, never a maximum, so the library
does not bind it (`src/server/interfaces/signed-url-options.interface.ts`). The field records the
caller's intent for a post-upload HEAD/size check and the scanner path; it enforces nothing at
presign time. Reading it as enforcement produces two opposite errors, and both are wrong: signing
off on an upload path as size-limited when it is not, and reporting the unbound signature as a bug
to fix in the presigner.

### `defaultPublicRead` is not a candidate for an environment flag

`publicRead` emits `ACL: public-read`. Modern AWS S3 buckets reject that with HTTP 400
`AccessControlListNotSupported`, and R2 ignores ACLs entirely, so on the two most common targets the
option is a hard failure or a silent no-op. It exists for the providers where it still works — the
DigitalOcean Spaces recipe sets it — and public access is otherwise a bucket policy, a CDN, or a
signed URL. Do not propose promoting it to a configurable default, and do not read a `publicRead`
path as the way to serve public objects.

### `STORAGE_ERROR_CODES` is a frozen contract, not a stringly-typed smell

The codes in `src/shared/constants/error-codes.constants.ts` do not change between minor versions —
host applications and clients pattern-match on them, which is the point of shipping them from the
`./shared` subpath with `as const`. Adding a code is additive and fine; renaming, removing or
repurposing one is a breaking change to every consumer. The `StorageErrorCode` union is derived from
the object, so the two cannot drift.

`STORAGE_ERROR_MESSAGES` and `STORAGE_ERROR_STATUS` are the opposite case: internal, never exported,
and free to change.

### A token in the barrel must also be in the module's `exports`

`src/server/index.ts` and `BymaxStorageModule.buildExports()` are two separate lists, and a
token in the first but not the second is a public name a consumer cannot inject: `@Global()`
auto-imports the module, it does not publish a provider the module withheld. Injecting such a
token raises `UnknownDependenciesException` and the application fails to boot.

`bymax-storage.module.spec.ts` asserts the pairing over every symbol the barrel exports, so a
token added to one list and not the other fails the suite by name. Nothing else covers it —
neither typecheck, lint, coverage nor the published-surface script exercises injection through
the barrel — so that test is the whole guard, and it is the reason this is a rule worth
knowing rather than one worth re-deriving.

A token in the barrel needs a provider, a consumer and an entry in `exports`, in the same
change. An *internal* token needs the opposite and is equally deliberate:
`BYMAX_STORAGE_IDEMPOTENCY_CACHE` has a provider and a consumer and is withheld from both
lists, because exporting it would freeze an implementation detail as public API. The pairing
to enforce is barrel ↔ `exports`, not provider ↔ `exports`.

Logging is the specific case that keeps coming up: `S3ClientProvider`, `FileScannerService`
and `StorageService` each construct `new Logger(ClassName)` from `@nestjs/common`, which is
the NestJS convention and the whole of the logging story here. Do not read a service that
constructs its own `Logger` as having missed an injectable one, and do not propose a logger
token — `app.useLogger(...)` already redirects every one of them.

### The `S3Client` is one instance for the process lifetime

`S3ClientProvider` creates it in `onModuleInit` and calls `destroy()` in `onApplicationShutdown`.
A change that constructs an `S3Client` per request or per operation leaks connection pools, and a
`destroy()` anywhere but shutdown breaks every later call. Credentials absent at init is not a
startup crash by design — the first operation fails with `STORAGE_NOT_CONFIGURED` (503) instead.

### AWS SDK v3 option names only

The retry knob is `maxAttempts`. `maxRetries` and `signatureVersion` are SDK v2 names that do not
exist in v3, which is SigV4-only; neither should appear in a diff or in a suggested fix.

### Every non-AWS provider recipe opts out of integrity checksums

`@aws-sdk/client-s3` ≥ 3.729.0 sends `x-amz-checksum-crc32` headers by default, and R2, B2, MinIO,
DigitalOcean Spaces and Wasabi reject them. Each non-AWS recipe in
`src/server/config/provider-recipes.ts` spreads `requestChecksumCalculation` and
`responseChecksumValidation` set to `'WHEN_REQUIRED'`. A new S3-compatible recipe without that
opt-out is a blocking finding; removing it from an existing one is the same finding.

### The path-traversal guard runs before the SDK, always

`KeyResolverService` is the boundary between a caller-supplied key and the AWS SDK: it rejects `..`
segments, a leading `/`, and a key that is empty after normalisation, and it applies `keyPrefix`.
Any path that reaches an SDK command with a key that did not go through it is a blocking finding,
however the key was obtained.

### Two documented limitations are not bugs to report

Both are stated in the deep-dive below and in the published docs; raising either as a defect costs a
round trip and changes nothing.

- **The idempotency cache is in-memory and per process instance.** Two replicas can each accept the
  same `idempotencyKey`. A cross-instance `IIdempotencyStore` is the planned replacement.
- **The signed-URL TTL clamp is deliberately asymmetric.** A `ttlSeconds` of zero or less throws;
  one above the configured maximum is silently clamped. Rejecting the degenerate value prevents an
  already-expired URL; clamping the high one keeps a ceiling an operational constraint rather than a
  per-request contract.

### The zero-dependency claim is part of the package

`package.json` ships `"dependencies": {}`, and everything the library needs is a peer dependency the
consuming application resolves. A diff that adds a runtime dependency changes the package's
supply-chain footprint for every consumer and needs to be argued as such, not slipped in as a
convenience — including a small utility that could be written inline.

### Internal services stay internal

`KeyResolverService`, `ValidationService`, `FileScannerService` and `S3ClientProvider` are not in the
barrel. The public surface is `StorageService`, `SignedUrlService`, `providerRecipes`, the DI tokens,
the public types, `StorageException`, `NoOpUploadValidator` and `NoOpFileScanner`. Adding an internal
service to `src/server/index.ts` widens the API this library has to keep working.

The architecture deep-dive that explains these rules — module wiring, the `S3Client`
lifecycle, the validation pipeline, the TTL clamp and the provider recipes — is in
`docs/architecture.md`. It is kept out of this file so the review rules stay within the
budget a reviewer actually reads.
